## Overview
Pokémon is a wordlwide phenomenon. Pokémon Red and Green were released in 1996 in Japan, and since then it has gone on to become the [highest grossing media franchise on the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises), grossing an estimated $94 billion USD. There's games, movies, cards, and more merchandise than I should realistically own. The core of this behemoth, the games, are produced every few years and are separated into generations where each generation has slightly different mechanics Pokémon. They are about you collecting fun and unique monsters, all while battling rivals and villains on your quest to be the very best, like no one ever was.

Despite its kid friendly veneer, Pokémon has quite a lot of depth to it. For a quick rundown each Pokémon has:
- 1 or 2 of 18 types, interacting through weaknesses, resistances, and immunities
- 6 stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed
- Base stats determening the growth rate and maximum value for each stat, unique to each species
- IVs, increasing each stat by up to 31, unique to each individual
- EVs, increasing each stat by up to 64, which are gained from defeating other Pokémon
- A movepool, the set of moves they have access to, of which they can only have 4 at a time

Conisdering that, it should come as no surprise that a competitive community has popped up around these games. The official, unofficial competitive community is Smogon.

Battles are conducted using their simulator, Pokémon Showdown. There are an absurd number of metagames you can play, all broken up into tiers and formats. The tier I will be focusing on is OU, short for overused and the standard tier that sees the most play, while the formats I will be looking at are singles and doubles. In both, each player brings 6 Pokémon to the battle, with only one Pokémon per side in singles and two in doubles.

The dataset was pulled from Smogon's usage [stats](https://www.smogon.com/stats/) which have been updated monthly since November 2014.


## Questions
- How did the variety of the previous generation's metagame change over its lifetime?
- How do the two formats compare to each other over that same timespan?
